This project is the culmination of my summer internship at NIH in the Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institutes on Aging. A poster was presented at the 2024 NIH Summer Poster Day, which was participated by over 790 interns.

Data was collected from four data repositories: Genome-Wide Association Studies
(GWAS) Catalog, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Database of Genotypes and
Phenotypes (dbGaP), and PubMed Central (PMC). We extracted and compiled relevant
data trends over time, ancestry information, techniques used, and sample. We used
Python-based data extraction (see code above) and Microsoft Excel sheets to ensure accurate and efficient
data management. This research includes 160 studies in all where PMC 42 studies;
dbGaP had 24 studies; GWAS had 43 studies; and GEO had 51 studies. The data pool
consists of European (n= 49%), Asian (n= 37%), African (n=8%), and others (n=6%).
